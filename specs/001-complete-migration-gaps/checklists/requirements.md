# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete SIWEA Migration - Gaps Analysis and Implementation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Overall Assessment: **PASS**

This specification successfully achieves all quality criteria:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on WHAT needs to be implemented (external service integration, transaction atomicity, business rules enforcement) and WHY (system-critical, data integrity, compliance) without specifying HOW (specific libraries, frameworks, or code structure).

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 43 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. For example, FR-001 specifies "CNOUA REST API client for consortium products 6814, 7701, 7709 with HTTPS, JSON payload, 10-second timeout" - this is precise enough to validate without prescribing implementation.

3. **Success Criteria Measurability**: All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - SC-004: "Claim search operations complete in under 3 seconds" (measurable, no tech details)
   - SC-007: "Test suite achieves minimum 80% code coverage" (measurable outcome)
   - SC-010: "Zero data integrity violations when running concurrent operations" (testable condition)

4. **User Scenarios**: All 6 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1-P4), acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format, and justification for priority assignment.

5. **Edge Cases**: 12 edge cases identified covering boundary conditions (OCORHIST counter overflow), error scenarios (database connection loss), and data quality issues (special characters in beneficiary names).

6. **Scope Boundaries**: Specification clearly defines what is IN scope (completing identified gaps to reach 100% migration) and what is OUT of scope (new features, schema changes, authentication system).

7. **Dependencies**: All external dependencies explicitly listed (CNOUA/SIPUA/SIMDA services, database schema, currency rates) with clear assumptions documented.

### Detailed Validation Notes

**Strengths**:
- Executive summary provides current implementation status (60-65% complete) and identifies precise gaps (5 categories)
- Each user story has clear business justification and independent test description
- Functional requirements organized by category (External Service Integration, Transaction Atomicity, Business Rules, UI/Display, Testing, Database)
- Success criteria directly traceable to business rules (BR-001 through BR-099)
- No technology leak: avoids mentioning .NET, React, EF Core, Polly, etc. in requirement statements (uses "System MUST" pattern)

**Areas of Excellence**:
- BR-019 (beneficiary requirement) → FR-015 → US3-Scenario1 → SC-009 (complete traceability)
- Performance targets specified as user-facing metrics (search < 3s, authorization < 90s, history < 500ms) not system metrics
- Error handling described in terms of user-visible behavior ("system displays VAL-007 error 'Favorecido é obrigatório'") not exception types

**No Issues Found**: This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` as needed.

## Recommendation

**APPROVED FOR PLANNING** - This specification meets all quality criteria and provides sufficient detail for implementation planning. No clarifications required before proceeding to `/speckit.plan`.

### Next Steps

1. Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan with architecture decisions
2. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate task breakdown from plan
3. Begin implementation starting with P1 user stories (External Service Integration, Transaction Atomicity)
