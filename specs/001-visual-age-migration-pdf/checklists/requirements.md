# Specification Quality Checklist: Comprehensive Visual Age Migration Analysis & Planning Document

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning and implementation
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - ✅ PASSED: Spec describes WHAT documentation to create, not HOW to implement code
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - ✅ PASSED: Primary user story focused on creating planning document for project approval and stakeholder alignment
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - ✅ PASSED: Executive summary section and business justification are comprehensible to C-level executives
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - ✅ PASSED: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present with comprehensive detail

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - ✅ PASSED: No clarification markers in specification
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - ✅ PASSED: All 62 functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (e.g., FR-001 "Document MUST contain 2-3 pages", FR-004 "180-220 AFP estimated total")
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - ✅ PASSED: All 15 success criteria have quantifiable metrics (e.g., SC-001 "minimum 50 pages", SC-004 "180-220 Adjusted Function Points", SC-006 "8 weeks development + 4 weeks homologation")
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - ✅ PASSED: Success criteria focus on document content and quality, not implementation technologies
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - ✅ PASSED: 10 detailed acceptance scenarios in P1 user story with Given-When-Then format
- [x] Edge cases are identified - ✅ PASSED: 8 edge cases covering function point variance, incomplete information, timeline adjustments, scope creep, methodology training, regulatory compliance
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - ✅ PASSED: "Out of Scope" section has 18 items clearly excluding implementation, training delivery, ongoing maintenance, additional integrations, etc.
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - ✅ PASSED: 13 assumptions covering source code access, database schema, team availability, MIGRAI methodology, Claude Code availability. 13 dependencies covering stakeholder availability, tooling, function point expertise, budget approval authority

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - ✅ PASSED: Each FR specifies measurable deliverable (e.g., FR-007 "all 42 business rules with ESQL code samples", FR-031 "AFP = UFP × VAF formula")
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - ✅ PASSED: Single comprehensive P1 user story covering complete document generation workflow from initiation to PDF delivery
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - ✅ PASSED: Specification enables creation of 50+ page document (SC-001) with complete legacy analysis (SC-002), technical architecture (SC-003), function points 180-220 AFP (SC-004), budget R$ 180K-220K (SC-005), 3-month timeline (SC-006)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - ✅ PASSED: Requirements focus on document content (what to analyze/document) not software implementation (how to code)

## Validation Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items validated successfully

**Key Strengths**:
1. Comprehensive requirements covering all aspects of migration planning document (legacy analysis, architecture, function points, timeline, MIGRAI methodology, budget)
2. Detailed function point analysis methodology (IFPUG 4.3.1) with specific component breakdown (EI/EO/EQ/ILF/EIF)
3. Clear 3-month timeline structure (8 weeks development in 6 phases + 4 weeks homologation)
4. Realistic budget calculation (200 AFP × R$ 750 = R$ 150,000 + infrastructure R$ 16,100 + additional R$ 9,500 + contingency 15% = R$ 201,250)
5. Well-defined MIGRAI methodology with six principles (Modernization, Intelligence, Gradual migration, Resilience, Automation, Integration)
6. Comprehensive Key Entities section providing detailed content specifications for each document section
7. Professional formatting requirements ensuring branded PDF output with Caixa Seguradora logo, table of contents, typography standards, color coding, and appendices

**Recommendations for Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to planning phase (`/speckit.plan`) to define implementation approach for document generation
2. Consider creating document generation tooling (LaTeX templates or Markdown-to-PDF pipeline) for programmatic updates
3. Establish function point analysis sessions with certified FPA practitioner to validate 180-220 AFP estimate
4. Schedule stakeholder reviews for executive summary, budget approval, and timeline alignment
5. Create diagram templates in Lucidchart/Draw.io for architecture, ER diagrams, sequence diagrams, and Gantt charts
6. Plan MIGRAI methodology training session for 6-person development team (4-8 hours)

## Notes

- This specification describes creation of a comprehensive planning and analysis document, NOT the actual software migration implementation
- The estimated 200 Adjusted Function Points refers to the Visual Age to .NET migration project scope, not the document creation effort itself
- Budget calculation R$ 201,250 is for the 3-month migration project (development + homologation), not for creating this planning document
- Payment milestones (20%/20%/30%/20%/10%) are aligned with migration project phases, would apply to migration contract
- Success criteria focus on document quality, completeness, and utility for decision-making rather than migration success metrics
- User story is written from perspective of project managers/stakeholders needing comprehensive planning document before proceeding
- The specification can be approved and used to generate the planning PDF document using templates and existing migration artifacts from specs/001-visualage-dotnet-migration/
