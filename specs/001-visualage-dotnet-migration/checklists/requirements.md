- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks completed successfully (Updated 2025-10-23 after dashboard addition)

### Details:

1. **No implementation details**: The specification successfully avoids mentioning .NET 9, React, or specific frameworks in the requirements and success criteria. These are only mentioned in the context of the migration goal itself, which is appropriate. The dashboard requirements focus on "what" needs to be displayed, not "how" to implement it.

2. **Focused on user value**: All user stories clearly articulate the value to insurance operators (search claims, authorize payments, view history, handle special products, manage workflow phases) and technical/management teams (migration status dashboard for project visibility).

3. **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: The specification uses business language (claims, payment authorization, beneficiary, indemnity, migration progress, project visibility) and avoids technical jargon. Portuguese field names are preserved to match operator familiarity.

4. **All mandatory sections completed**:
   - User Scenarios & Testing: 6 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios (P1-P6)
   - Requirements: 55 functional requirements across 7 categories, 13 key entities (including dashboard entities)
   - Success Criteria: 19 measurable outcomes (including dashboard-specific metrics)

5. **No clarification markers**: The specification makes informed decisions based on the legacy code analysis without requiring user clarification.

6. **Testable and unambiguous requirements**: Each FR is specific and verifiable (e.g., "FR-001: System MUST allow operators to search claims using one of three mutually exclusive criteria").

7. **Measurable success criteria**: All 19 SC entries include specific metrics:
   - SC-001: "under 3 seconds"
   - SC-002: "under 90 seconds"
   - SC-003/SC-004: "100% data accuracy/preservation"
   - SC-008: "accuracy to 2 decimal places"
   - SC-012: "95% of operators"
   - SC-014: "within 30 seconds"
   - SC-015: "all 6 user stories, 55 functional requirements, 10 database entities, and 3 external service integrations"
   - SC-016: "within 5 minutes"
   - SC-017: "at least 5 key metrics"
   - SC-018: "100% of dashboard cards"

8. **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes and business metrics without mentioning specific technologies (e.g., "Operators can search and retrieve any claim" vs "API responds in X ms", "Dashboard displays migration progress" vs "React component renders chart").

9. **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of the 6 user stories includes 2-7 Given-When-Then scenarios for comprehensive testing coverage.

10. **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases documented covering payment overruns, concurrent updates, service availability, date/time sync, currency rates, rollback scenarios, counter limits, and character encoding.

11. **Scope clearly bounded**: Comprehensive "Out of Scope" section with 14 specific exclusions prevents scope creep and sets clear expectations.

12. **Dependencies and assumptions**:
    - 17 assumptions documented (database schema, authentication, styling, dashboard metrics, etc.)
    - 10 dependencies identified (database access, validation services, runtime, authentication, charting libraries, real-time updates, etc.)

## Notes

This specification is ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase without requiring any modifications. The comprehensive analysis of the legacy Visual Age EZEE source code has provided sufficient detail to create a complete, unambiguous specification with no need for clarification questions.

**Key Additions**:
- **Caixa Seguradora Logo**: Specification includes logo requirements (FR-036, FR-037, SC-013, and Branding Assets section) to ensure brand consistency
- **Migration Dashboard**: New User Story 6 (P6) adds comprehensive migration tracking dashboard similar to reference implementation at https://sicoob-sge3-jv1x.vercel.app/dashboard
  - 13 new functional requirements (FR-038 through FR-050) covering dashboard features
  - 3 new entities for tracking migration status, components, and performance metrics
  - 6 new success criteria (SC-014 through SC-019) for dashboard functionality
  - Dashboard provides real-time visibility into project progress, component migration status, test results, and performance comparisons

The dashboard serves as a project management and stakeholder communication tool, allowing teams to monitor the Visual Age to .NET 9 migration progress without impacting end-user claim processing operations.
