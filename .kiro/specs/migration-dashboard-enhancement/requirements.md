# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the enhancement of the existing migration dashboard for the Caixa Seguradora Visual Age to .NET 9 migration project. The enhanced dashboard will provide comprehensive visibility into migration progress, function point analysis, performance metrics, and detailed component tracking to support both technical teams and management oversight.

## Glossary

- **Migration_Dashboard**: The web-based interface displaying real-time migration status and metrics
- **Function_Points**: Standardized measurement units for software functionality complexity and size
- **Legacy_System**: The existing IBM Visual Age EZEE system being migrated
- **Target_System**: The new .NET 9 with React frontend system
- **Component_Migration**: Individual migration units including screens, business rules, database entities, and external services
- **SIWEA_System**: Sistema de Autorização de Pagamento de Indenizações de Sinistros (Claims Payment Authorization System)
- **External_Services**: Third-party validation services (CNOUA, SIPUA, SIMDA)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to view comprehensive migration progress with function point analysis, so that I can accurately track project completion and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the migration dashboard, THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display overall migration progress as a percentage with visual progress bar
2. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show total function points identified, migrated, and remaining with numerical breakdown
3. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display function point complexity distribution across simple, average, and complex categories
4. WHERE function point analysis is available, THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show estimated vs actual effort comparison
5. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL update progress metrics automatically every 30 seconds without manual refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to monitor individual component migration status with detailed breakdowns, so that I can identify bottlenecks and prioritize development efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display component-level status for all 57 identified components (2 screens, 42 business rules, 10 database entities, 3 external services)
2. WHEN viewing component details, THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show status indicators (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked) with color coding
3. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display estimated hours, actual hours spent, and remaining hours for each component
4. WHERE components are blocked, THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show blocking reason and assigned resolver
5. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL provide drill-down capability to view detailed component information and history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to compare performance metrics between legacy and target systems, so that I can validate migration success and identify optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display side-by-side performance comparison between Legacy_System and Target_System
2. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show response time metrics with average, minimum, and maximum values
3. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display throughput metrics in requests per second for both systems
4. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show concurrent user capacity comparison with peak load indicators
5. WHERE performance data is available, THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display memory usage and error rate comparisons

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want to track test coverage and validation status across all migration components, so that I can ensure migration quality and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display automated test results with total tests, passed tests, and failed tests
2. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show code coverage percentage for migrated components
3. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display External_Services validation status with connectivity indicators
4. WHEN test failures occur, THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show failure details and assigned resolution owner
5. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL track regression test results comparing Legacy_System and Target_System outputs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to view migration timeline and milestone progress, so that I can understand project delivery status and communicate with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display project timeline with key milestones and current progress
2. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show user story completion status for all 6 identified user stories
3. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display estimated completion date based on current velocity
4. WHERE milestones are at risk, THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show risk indicators and mitigation plans
5. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL provide exportable progress reports for stakeholder communication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor system health and external dependencies, so that I can ensure migration environment stability and resolve issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display system health indicators for API availability, database connectivity, and External_Services status
2. WHEN system issues occur, THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show alert notifications with severity levels
3. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL display recent activities timeline with chronological task completion
4. THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL show environment status for development, testing, and production systems
5. WHERE external dependencies fail, THE Migration_Dashboard SHALL provide diagnostic information and resolution steps
