# Quick Start Guide - Modern CSS Styling

## What Was Fixed

Your Caixa Seguradora Claims System went from **completely unstyled** to **modern and beautiful** with:

- âœ… Professional Caixa Seguradora branding (blue and orange)
- âœ… Modern card-based layouts with shadows
- âœ… Sticky header with logo and navigation
- âœ… Beautiful footer
- âœ… Styled forms with proper radio buttons and inputs
- âœ… Loading states and error alerts
- âœ… Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- âœ… Visual regression tests with Playwright

## Start the Application

```bash
cd /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa\ Seguradora/POC\ Visual\ Age/frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5175/claims/search**

## What You'll See

### Before (what you reported):
- Plain black text on white background
- No styling at all
- Basic HTML form

### After (what you'll see now):
- **Blue gradient header** with "Pesquisa de Sinistros"
- **Caixa Seguradora logo** in top navigation
- **Modern card** with shadow and rounded corners
- **Styled radio buttons** for search type selection
- **Professional form inputs** with labels and placeholders
- **Blue submit button** with loading spinner
- **Instructions card** with info icon
- **Sticky navigation** with active state highlighting
- **Footer** with copyright information

## Test Visual Regression

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install

# Run tests in interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Or run headless
npm run test:e2e

# Generate baseline screenshots (first run)
npm run test:e2e:update

# View test report
npm run test:e2e:report
```

## Color Reference

| Color | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| Blue (#0066CC) | Primary buttons, active states, headers |
| Orange (#FF6B00) | Accents, highlights |
| White (#FFFFFF) | Cards, backgrounds |
| Light Gray (#F8F9FA) | Page background |
| Red (#EF4444) | Errors, validation |

## Key Files Changed

1. **src/index.css** - Brand colors and design system
2. **src/App.tsx** - Header, footer, navigation
3. **src/pages/ClaimSearchPage.tsx** - Modern search page
4. **playwright.config.ts** - Visual regression testing (NEW)
5. **tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts** - Tests (NEW)

## Next Steps (Optional)

The following pages still need migration from Bootstrap to Tailwind:

1. ClaimDetailPage.tsx
2. MigrationDashboardPage.tsx
3. All child components

See **CSS_FIX_SUMMARY.md** for detailed migration guide.
